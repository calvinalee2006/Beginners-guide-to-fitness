     <p>Like we said before, adopting a healthy lifestyle into your weekly routine is going 
        to seem difficult, but the best way to make this change is to start with small goals 
        and a slow start. 
     </p>
     <h2>Cardio</h2>
     <p>From personal experience, cardio exercises is the first type of exercise a person thinks
        of when wanting to get back into shape. Cardio fitness is anything that will:<br />
            A. Raises your heart and breathing rate<br />
            B. Improves the function of your heart, lungs and circulatory system states
            Trevor Thieme, C.S.C.S and Beachbody's senior manager of fitness and nutrition <a href="https://www.beachbodyondemand.com/blog/what-is-cardio">Here</a> 
     </p>
     <p>Cardio does not have to be a marathon run or climbing Mt.Everest, It can be something simple as
        going outside and playing with children or yard work. Here are some more examples of exercise: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>walking</li>
            <li>Running</li>
            <li>Cycling</li>
            <li>Swimming</li>
            <li>Sports activities</li>
            <li>Jumping Rope</li>
            <li>Playing outside with your children</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Just to name a few!</p>
        <p><b>Remember</b> you just need to keep the intensity high enough to challenge your heart and lungs!</p>
        <p>A study in the <i>Journal of Physiology</i> found that <b>Four to five cardio workouts a week is optimal 
            for cardiovascular health</b><br />

            <p>For now this is how we recommend you starting with one of these activities:<br />
            - Start off with a nice walk through your local area for approx. 30 minutes. This small walk will give you 
            a chance to enjoy nature at its finest. <br />
            -If the weather is not cooperating and you have to stay inside, we recommend using youtube and finding a nice 30 min workout! {/*Link here*/} </p>
