## React.js Journey
>The journey was very difficult to me since this was the first large idea driven project using React.js. Used many web packages and even had to deploy my site using vercel.
>(I will be back to that in a second). One of my biggest learning accomplishments with this project is teaching myself how to properly use React-Router. I learned there are
>positives and negatives when using react-router, especially when it comes to deployment on github. Becuase of this I had to deploy my side using vercel, I could have 
>used HashRouter for deployment on github but the more I read into it, the more that was not the highly suggested choice in the matter. 

>I used bootstrap to help design the buttons for my page and used downloaded react-slick to use for my carousel of pictures on my cardio page. Also learning to properly
>use ReactHooks was a challenge when designing my fride and my makeshift chart. A lot of tutorials and documentation was used to design these two things to where I can
>say with confidence "I have a lot to learn". When it comes to design the last thing I would like to mention is the 714 lines of CSS I used to design the page, that was 
>difficult when it came to properly using "className" and making sure things were disgned properly. 

>Not going to lie, a lot of documentation, help from the online community and ChatAPI was used to help make this page become a reality, This project was 4 months in the
>making, granted it looks like somthing a regular developer can finish in 4 days. One of the things I would do different is to first outline my design, that way I would 
>have an idea of where to go, so it wouldn't take me that long. I would also look of differnt packages to use when it comes to styling, to hopefully shorten up my styles.css. 
>I would also in the future how to use a workout Api to include into my page. All in all, this was a heavy learning expericne, and hopfully I will contine my
>software development journey with React.
